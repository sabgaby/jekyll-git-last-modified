# Jekyll Git Last Modified in Unix Timestamp
Based on nquinlan's plugin [Jekyll-git-last-modified](https://github.com/nquinlan/jekyll-git-last-modified). Go there to see how the plugin works.

I mainly added support for collections(documents), and made it so the DateTime is converted into Unix Timestamp. I need this format to [comply](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/indexing/formatting-your-data/#formatting-recommendations) with Algolia, my search engine.
